   --- NYI features / in development ---
------------------------------------------------------------
- styling to exercise selection buttons not applied (currently just A and B buttone) 
- Styling needs revision to custom exercise select dropdown (btn-b popup frame): 1) Review the font size/line height/padding/cursor:pointer for the dropdown bars
- Rainbow randomization button NYI (custom exercise selection popup)
   --> should replace target exercise with a random item from any active array

Audio placeholders for action-start need to be swapped with exercise names:
-- need audio files for exercise names and added to resources
-- need to path the audio files, set as appropriate variables in JS.
[!] -- helper function to analyze current workout move in MasterExercise array --> needs an exercise index global-var counter incrementing on each new exercise to relate to position of move in the master array's index.
-- MasterExerciseArray needs to be saved as a JSON string to local storage (contains all exercises for current workout)

Workout structure toggles affecting master-array construction:
[!] helper function for making different versions of the master array based on workout ordering (muscle-focus, cycle, or true-random ordering).
--> These options should occupy placeholder 3
--> generate a cycle by default, then target arrangement on event listener when dropdown is selected.

-------------------- low priority: --------------------
placeholder dropdown 4 on exercise select screen --> audio pack selection?
[?] Data re-structuring for audio-pack organization
-- directory for each audio pack "AudioPack_X". 
-- consistent names "workoutStart1_X.mp3", "actionEnd2_X".
-- need to document all SFX audio packs
-- [!] Workout names are too broad to get files for, just focus on making the SFX and timer notices interchangeable.

--- Bug List ---
------------------------------------------------------------
known bugs:
- slider values revert to default when hitting back button (refreshes the page) 
   --> use local storage to render last selection values to the HTML shown on the slider screen

- First workout-type does not disable a muscle group already selected by dropdown 2 (second workout-type) on the workout list creation screen.

  --- Dev Log ---
------------------------------------------------------------
4/18 :
- Javascript Mobile version uploaded; many major changes, so it can be considered it's own offshoot.
- I will track changes more closely as I develop this further.
- Starting point: timing selection sliders, workout list-selection, and timer functionality all work at a basic degree

DEV LOG : --- 4/18/2025 ---
- fixed lack of randomization for workout items, cleaning up a leftover randomizer prototype that repeated items. Now, repetitions will only occur if the entire array is exhausted
- Added annotations made within timer logic to better explain different behavior triggers
- changed names from prototype ones into more functional ones matching the streamlined visual design.
// added css for header color management through the classes called during timer operation
// edited class names for consistency -> revised underscores to dash separator like class ".is_paused" -> ".is-paused"
// [!] WARNING : odd behavior in how the sets are calculated/cycled, 
//          needs investigation as to why unexpected cycle amounts (too few actions and no lightActions) 
//          --> observed from 2 actions 2 sets; appeared to only do 2 sets of 1 action with 1 break between
// [?] possible solution: Target array isn't duplicated yet? But then why not iterate through the whole array once?
// [!] WARNING : Interval not clearing at end of workout (every second, continues, trying to switch to a timer)
//      [?] check for ending location, if remaining sets == 0 then clear interval
//      --> all locations for "Clear interval" identified, it was called in the prototype app's disable/enableSliders functionality
//      attempting a straight call of clearInterval(timerInterval) where the prior functions were managed
//      NOTE: removed enable/disable sliders since we're controlling that by switching displays and re-rendering the screen instead
// [+] countdown cycle fixed, cycles are moving through as expected

3/18:
IMPORTANT UPDATE: Shifting from array structure to object oriented structure where each exercise is an object.
reason: previous structure was sorting exercise types into arrays. This led to redundancy and difficulty in making arrays where certain situations applied. Damaged modularity and data normalization.
Solution: making exercises into objects allows to make a property containing ".info" lists, which are string tags with keywords. This allows for the filtering of exercises containing or lacking a certain tag.
[!] greater emphasis will be put on re-working functions to manipulate objects in this manner
- reviewed all current exercises (around 350) and arranged them into proper primary muscle groups. This will make tagging easier for the object translation

3/11:
 Researched a set of core exercises and basic stretch routine to hit all muscle groups. Data added to stretches_doc.py. The program is big enough that it should be divided into subsequent parts.
 Begin logic for continuous exercise, opo. action X interval format that the basic app already has.
 Later goal will be to modulate patterns like active exercises and rest intervals, using sliders, but the simpler logic takes precedent.
 Also, found good resources for bot-voices, though I'm not sure if it's a good idea to announce the source, since I'm not professionally affiliated with the company. Still, it's not for-profit, so it shouldn't cause a fuss.

3/8:
 Data prepped for audio clips. Subset of share-able ones will be added to this repo.
 Data organization for folder structure is important when dealing with a lot of material, which is meant to be personalized/augmented. Modularity is the intention of this project.

3/7:
 update logic for counting rounds and shifting interval activities while keeping main motion consistent. 
UI consistency for top-widgets like exercise label, timer, and round counter.
!! Currently using an input statement for granular control to step through behavior one second at a time in update_timer()

3/6 : current scope
  Make a timer assuming the workout type is arms and there's only one interval set for abs.
  complete: sliders actively show workout duration for calculated core factors of motions, rounds per motion, work time, and interval time
  complete: Can generate random unique items from target muscle group list
            - chosen motions display correctly in left column
            - the number of chosen items correctly uses the slider value for number of exercises
    NEXT:
    Make display for interval activities in right column
      - needs to be overwritten when moving to next main motion
    Make countdown work for activity poriton
    Countdown needs to work for interval portion

    FIX - left-display needs to delete area when generating new set
    
---------------------------------------------------------
    NYI: 
    *sound test for audio triggers
      *sound test button for random drops
      ****implement start, halfway, 10s warning, and end audio triggers.
    output 
      --- on-demand print button
    workout type selection
    mid-session longer break (toggle checkbox?)
