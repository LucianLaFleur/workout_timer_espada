3/8:
 Data prepped for audio clips. Subset of share-able ones will be added to this repo.
 Data organization for folder structure is important when dealing with a lot of material, which is meant to be personalized/augmented. Modularity is the intention of this project.

3/7:
 update logic for counting rounds and shifting interval activities while keeping main motion consistent. 
UI consistency for top-widgets like exercise label, timer, and round counter.
!! Currently using an input statement for granular control to step through behavior one second at a time in update_timer()

3/6 : current scope
  Make a timer assuming the workout type is arms and there's only one interval set for abs.
  complete: sliders actively show workout duration for calculated core factors of motions, rounds per motion, work time, and interval time
  complete: Can generate random unique items from target muscle group list
            - chosen motions display correctly in left column
            - the number of chosen items correctly uses the slider value for number of exercises
    NEXT:
    Make display for interval activities in right column
      - needs to be overwritten when moving to next main motion
    Make countdown work for activity poriton
    Countdown needs to work for interval portion

    FIX - left-display needs to delete area when generating new set

    NYI: 
    *sound test for audio triggers
      *sound test button for random drops
      ****implement start, halfway, 10s warning, and end audio triggers.
    output 
      --- on-demand print button
    workout type selection
    mid-session longer break (toggle checkbox?)
